# Privacy Policy for Ampoose

Effective date: February 12, 2026
Version: 1.0

Ampoose is a browser extension that helps users export their own Facebook timeline posts into JSON files.

## Scope
- This policy applies to the Ampoose extension running in the user's browser.
- Processing is local to the user's device in the browser/extension context.

## What Ampoose Does
- Runs on Facebook pages (`www.facebook.com` and `web.facebook.com`) where the user is signed in.
- Reads timeline post data required to generate user-requested exports.
- Writes export files to the user's local Downloads folder.

## Data We Process
Ampoose may process:
- Post content text
- Post identifiers
- Post timestamps
- Profile/timeline identifiers needed to organize export files
- Local extension settings and calibration metadata

## Data Collection and Transmission
- Ampoose does not run an Ampoose backend for data ingestion.
- Ampoose does not transmit exported post data to Ampoose-owned servers.
- Ampoose does not collect analytics or telemetry about user content.

## Third-Party Services
- No third-party analytics/tracking SDKs are used.
- Ampoose communicates only with Facebook endpoints needed to read timeline data for export.

## Data Sharing and Sales
- Ampoose does not sell personal data.
- Ampoose does not share personal data with advertisers or data brokers.

## Retention and Deletion
- Extension state is stored locally in Chrome extension storage.
- Export files are stored locally on the user's device.
- Users can delete exported files at any time.
- Users can remove locally stored extension data by uninstalling the extension.

## User Rights and Control
Users control when exports run and can:
- Start/stop exports at any time
- Delete generated files
- Uninstall the extension to remove local extension data

## Security
Ampoose is designed to minimize data handling and keep processing local. No storage system is perfect, but Ampoose avoids unnecessary transmission and remote retention by design.

## Changes to This Policy
If extension behavior changes, this policy will be updated and the effective date/version above will be revised.
