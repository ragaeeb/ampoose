# Privacy Policy for Ampoose

Effective date: February 12, 2026

Ampoose is a browser extension that helps users export their own Facebook timeline posts into JSON files.

## What the extension does
- Runs on Facebook pages (`www.facebook.com` and `web.facebook.com`) where the user is signed in.
- Reads timeline post data needed to generate exports.
- Writes export files to the user’s local Downloads folder.

## Information processed
Ampoose may process:
- Post content text
- Post identifiers
- Post timestamps
- Profile/timeline identifiers needed to organize export files
- Local extension settings and calibration metadata

## How data is used
Data is used only to:
- Build and download user-requested export files
- Maintain local extension runtime state needed for export behavior

## Data sharing and selling
- Ampoose does not sell personal information.
- Ampoose does not transmit export data to Ampoose-owned servers.
- Ampoose does not use analytics, telemetry, or ad SDKs.

## Storage and retention
- Extension state is stored locally using Chrome extension storage.
- Export files are saved locally to the user’s device.
- Data remains under user control and can be removed by deleting files and uninstalling the extension.

## Permissions used
- `storage`: store local settings/calibration data.
- `downloads`: save export files locally.
- Facebook host access: run only on required Facebook pages.

## Third-party services
Ampoose does not call third-party analytics or tracking services. It communicates with Facebook endpoints only as required to read timeline data for export.

## Security
Ampoose is designed to minimize collected data and process it locally. No method of electronic storage is perfectly secure, but the extension is designed around local-only handling for export workflows.

## Changes to this policy
This policy may be updated when extension behavior changes. Updates will be reflected by revising the effective date.
