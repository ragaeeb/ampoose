# Legacy Parity Fixtures

This folder stores fixture data and golden payloads used to preserve behavior parity with legacy Ampoose runtime contracts.

Baseline reference:
- Legacy repo: `/Users/rhaq/workspace/ampoose`
- Baseline commit: `42247b638fb506b22d895f6152249508a571fcd1`

Current fixtures are synthetic contract fixtures (export/chunk/checkpoint/resume/calibration). Add real captured fixture payloads here when extending parity coverage.
